## The Project Idea

The following application was my first-ever attempt at working with [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) and familiarizing myself with [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). The goal of the following project was to develop a racing game that allows 2 players to drive 2 karts around a drawn race track using one workstation by sharing a common keyboard with different sets of keys.

Faced difficulties?
<br>
Java is quite similar to C# semantically and syntactically, therefore the biggest difficulties faced were learning the [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) interface as well as some minor syntax differences. As for the project itself, I had a few failed attempts at importing the .png files for the go_karts used as well as fine-tuning the karts turning points. 

How can the following application be improved?
<br>
There's a huge stream of ideas that comes to mind however a good starting point would be the implementation of collision detection. The following feature was something that I have attempted to implement but unfortunately have not finished as of yet.

## User Guide on How to Run the Application ? 

To run the application, follow the steps bellow:

Step 1:
Navigate towards the following directory path .../single_player_kart_game/out/single_player_kart_game_jar/single_player_kart_game.jar
Step 2:
Execute the .jar file!

P.S: In essence the 'jar' file is the java applications packaged into a single file. To run .jar files, make sure you have [Java Runtime Environment](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp) installed on your device.

Alternatively:

 you may want to import the application into an IDE for example the [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) that was used to develop the application itself. In order to do so you will require to import the entire root directory i.e., single_player_kart_game folder. If an error occurs, make sure that the src folder has the 3 crucial files i.e., Main.Java, RaceCars.Java, RacingPanel.Java and raceCarImg folder.
